# algorithms
Coursera course on algorithms from Princeton

To build up my competency with algorithms, I recently started a course on algorithms from Coursera. Because I didn't feel like spending more time to pick up Java, I decided to translate all the projects and submissions into a Python implementation.

I will continue to add to this repo as I tackle more problems.

P.S. For someone without a computer science background, this is proving more challenging than I thought!
